    In Bergen we train with sword and buckler at Ulriken bydelssenter. We also often train together with
    Bergen HEMA. Our trainings are open to both beginners and advanced practitioners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone who wants to try gets two free trial weeks so they can get an impression of what it's like to train
    with us. If you want to continue training after this, just sign up for the club - you
    pay for one semester at a time. You only need regular workout clothes and indoor shoes, all
    swords, masks, etc. can be borrowed from the club in the beginning. HEMA and historical fencing is an exciting
    activity with a unique historical element, it's also great exercise!
