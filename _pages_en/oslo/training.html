  <h1>Train historical fencing and HEMA in Oslo</h1>
</div>

<div class="row row--indent spacing-4">
  <p>
    In Oslo we train with rapier, Italian single-handed sword and longsword. We have training every week during the school year and
    beginners are welcome! For longsword we have a separate training for beginners without their own equipment, while for rapier and
    single-handed sword the trainings are shared between beginners and advanced practitioners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone who wants to try gets two free trial weeks so they can get an impression of what it's like to train with us. If you want
    to continue training after this, just sign up for the club - you pay for one semester at a time. You only need regular workout clothes
    and indoor shoes, all swords, masks, etc. can be borrowed from the club in the beginning. HEMA and historical fencing is an exciting
    activity with a unique historical element, it's also great exercise!

          <strong>Time: </strong>Mondays 19:00 - 20:30 (September - June)<br />

          The rapier is a long thrust-focused sword popular in Europe from the 16th century. Rapier fencing is in some ways
          the predecessor to modern sport fencing. In Oslo our primary source is Bruchius, a German fencing master from the
          17th century.

        <p>
          On Tuesdays we train Italian single-handed sword, also called sidesword in modern times. The sidesword
          is used for both cuts and thrusts and was particularly popular in Italy in the 16th century. The trainings are largely
          based on a fencing manual written by Giovanni dall'Agocchie in the 17th century.

          The longsword is usually used with two hands and was used in battle, duels and as a sport in the Middle Ages and
          Renaissance. It is today the largest branch within HEMA. We train longsword with a focus on the German
          Lichtenauer tradition.

          On Wednesdays you need your own equipment and we have the opportunity to spar and drill with fewer restrictions and
