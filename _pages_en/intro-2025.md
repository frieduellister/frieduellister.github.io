# Free intro session August 2025

We will host a free intro session to HEMA / historical fencing in August for all interested. Here you will get to try all our weapons and get an introduction to HEMA. Register your email and we will contact you in August regarding time and place for the intro session.

If you are unable to attend, feel free to join one of our regular trainings. There are always many new people joining each semester. Regular trainings usually resume at the end of August, see information on our website or get in touch.
