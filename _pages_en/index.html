    Fekteklubben Frie Duellister (FKFD) is a club where we practice and teach historical fencing and HEMA
    (Historical European Martial Arts). Frie Duellister was founded in Bergen in 2003 and is Norway's largest and oldest
    HEMA club. HEMA is a collective term for martial arts based on historical sources from Europe, including
    fencing with historical weapons, wrestling, etc. from the Middle Ages to the end of the 19th century. We currently have branches in
    Oslo, Bergen and Tromsø. Most people who start training with us have no other training background, and HEMA is perfect
    for those who want a slightly different activity that combines exercise, martial arts and historical interest.
