  <p>In Tromsø, two of our longest-standing members are based.</p>
  <p>
    Jens Peder and Erik have been members and instructors in the club since 2010 and have been instructing since 2012! Our branch in
    Tromsø is as far as we know the world's northernmost HEMA club and has a large offering in relation to the number of members and
    the city's size. In Tromsø you can learn to fence with longsword, montante (extra long sword) and sword & buckler.
