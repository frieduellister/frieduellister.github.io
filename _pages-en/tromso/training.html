  <h1>Train historical fencing and HEMA in Tromsø</h1>
</div>

<div class="row row--indent spacing-4">
  <p>
    In Tromsø we train with sword & buckler, montante and longsword. All trainings take place at Borgtun school and are open
    to beginners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone who wants to try gets two free trial weeks so they can get an impression of what it's like to train with us. If you want
    to continue training after this, just sign up for the club - you pay for one semester at a time. You only need regular workout clothes
    and indoor shoes, all swords, masks, etc. can be borrowed from the club in the beginning. HEMA and historical fencing is an exciting
    activity with a unique historical element, it's also great exercise!
