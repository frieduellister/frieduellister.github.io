## Trial trainings

Everyone can try training with us for free before deciding to become a member. Everyone gets 2 free trial weeks where you can train as much as you want and try all our weapons.

## Price

Membership in the club costs NOK 1000,- per semester and provides access to all our trainings. Payment requests are sent out via Spond each semester.

## Registration

To become a member of the club, you must register in our membership system Spond. This is done after you have completed your trial trainings with us. Ask an instructor about registration. Once this is done, you will receive a confirmation email with a link to our social channels and a download link for the Spond app where you have access to our training calendar.

## Age

We have no separate groups for children and we generally do not accept members under 16 years of age.
