    In our city of origin Bergen, we have been fencing with sword and buckler for over 20 years! Our focus is on sword & buckler according to
    the manual i.33 which is Europe's oldest known fencing manual, written in Latin by monks in today's Germany at the end of
    the 13th century.

        <p>
          Jo has been doing HEMA since 2015. He has tried many weapons within HEMA and had a particular focus on sword &
          buckler. Jo has among others trained with one of our founders and pioneers in Norwegian HEMA and fencing with
          sword & buckler in general, Thomas Nyløkken.

        <p>
          Together, Jo and Martin have revived the club in Bergen after Corona and they now hold regular trainings with
          sword & buckler!

        <p>
          Martin has been doing HEMA since 2016. He has focused on sword & buckler but has also tried several other
          weapons including Spanish rapier fencing. Like Jo, he has trained with Thomas Nyløkken, Bjørn Joachimsen and
          the rest of the club's "old guard" in Bergen.
