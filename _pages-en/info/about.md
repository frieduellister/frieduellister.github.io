Fekteklubben Frie Duellister (FKFD) was started in Bergen in 2002 with the purpose of practicing medieval combat and fencing with a focus on duels rather than group fighting, which had traditionally been the focus in the Norwegian reenactment community. At this time, the club's focus was on a source known as I.33 from the Middle Ages, which describes fencing with sword and buckler. As members moved around, the club expanded to Oslo and Tromsø. Several early HEMA clubs in Europe were established in the early 2000s, and over the past 20+ years the community and activity have seen significant growth.

Fekteklubben Frie Duellister is by far Norway's largest club within HEMA and historical fencing. In addition to several training sessions per week, we are active at medieval festivals, organize social events, participate in tournaments and training weekends, hold beginner courses, etc.

Since 2016, the club has organized a major annual tournament at Bygdøy that attracts participants from large parts of Europe. Since 2018, the tournament has been known as the Oslo Penguin Cup, with both beginners and some of the world's best HEMA practitioners making the trip every year.


## Organization

Fekteklubben Frie Duellister is a voluntary and democratic association where the board is elected by the club's members. The board works to run the club, promote historical fencing/HEMA, and ensure that everything from finances to equipment and training is in order.

In addition to the board, we have many contributors in the form of our instructors and others who contribute to the club in various ways.

Our members hold training sessions, introduce newcomers to HEMA, organize trips and activities, help with purchasing and storing equipment, organize our annual tournament, and study sources for everyone's benefit. The club is a true democratic community effort!
